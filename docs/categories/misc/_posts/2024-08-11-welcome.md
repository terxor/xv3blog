Welcome to the first blog post.

The blog posts are written in plain markdown.

```py
# A function which says something
def say_hi():
  print('hi! code will be customized to look good')
```

Blog posts:
- You can view all posts on *Blog* page.
- You can view posts based on category or topic on *Categories* page.
- You can view posts of an author through the *Team* page.

You can also write math. Just set `katex: true` in the source meta section:

$$
S = \sum_{1 \le i \le n}{a_i}
$$
